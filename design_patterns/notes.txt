What are design patterns?

    1. A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a common problem within a specific context in software design.
    2. Patterns are blueprints that can be applied in multiple situations, but they are not direct pieces of code.
    3. They focus on object interactions, system architecture, and how classes/objects communicate.


Benefits of Design Pattern
    
    1. Code reusability - patterns provide proven solutions that can be applied in multiple projects.
    2. Maintainability - Encourages clean, understandable and structured code, which is easier to maintain and extend.
    3. Communication - Design patterns act as a common language between developers, improving communication and understanding.
    4. Scalability - Design patterns help in structuring code to support future scaling with fewer refactors.
    5. Efficiency - Avoids reinventing the wheel by using well-tested and widely accepted solutions.
