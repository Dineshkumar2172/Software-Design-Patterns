Consider a scenario where you have different data parsers (e.g. CSV, XML and JSON). Each parser follows the same steps: open file, parse data and close file.

Without the template method pattern, you might end up duplicating the common steps in each parser class.

Problems in our code implemented without template pattern :-

        1. Code Duplication: The openFile() and closeFile() methods are duplicated in both parsers.

        2. Any changes to the common logic would require changes in every parser, violating the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
