Momento Pattern

Problem: How to provide undo/redo functionality or state restoration without exposing the objects internal state and breaking encapsulation.

Solution: The memento pattern captures the internal state of an object in a memento, allowing the object to restore its state later on without revealing internal details.

Memento Pattern Structure
    1. Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
    2. Memento: captures and stores the internal state of the originator.
    3. CareTaker: Manages and stores the mementos, without modifying them.
