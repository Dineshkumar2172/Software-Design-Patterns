Problems in code implemented in WithoutStrategyPattern directory

        1. The PaymentService class has multiple responsibilities (deciding the payment type and then processing it)

        2. Additing new payment method required modifying existing PaymentService class. (Violation of OCP)

        3. The use of if-else conditions will make the code more harder to maintain as more payment types are added.

With Strategy Pattern - the logic for each payment method is encapsulated into separate strategy classes, and the PaymentService (Context Class)
delegates the ask of payment processing to one of these strategies at runtime.
