    // The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, making them compatible without modifying existing code.

    // ðŸ”¹ Key Components
    //      Target Interface â†’ Defines the expected interface for the client.
    //      Adaptee (Existing Class) â†’ Has an incompatible interface that needs adaptation.
    //      Adapter â†’ Converts the Adaptee's interface into the Target Interface.
    //      Client â†’ Uses the Target Interface without knowing about the adaptation.

    //Example: Charging Different Devices with a Universal Adapter
    //      Imagine we have a mobile charger that only accepts USB-C, but we have an old micro-USB phone. We need an Adapter to make them work together.

    // âœ… Integrating legacy code with modern systems.
    // âœ… Making two incompatible interfaces work together.
    // âœ… Avoiding code modification in existing classes.
