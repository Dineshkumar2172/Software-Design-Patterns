# ðŸ”¥ How to Be MAANG-Ready for LLD Interviews

## âœ… 1. Go Beyond Basics: Real-World Scalable Systems  
Instead of just knowing design patterns, **learn how to apply them** in real-world **scalable** applications:

- **Design URL Shortener** â€“ Uses Hashing, Database sharding, and Caching (Redis).
- **Design Parking Lot System** â€“ Uses Factory, Strategy, and Observer Patterns.
- **Design Rate Limiter** â€“ Uses Token Bucket Algorithm, Redis.
- **Design Thread Pool Executor** â€“ Uses Singleton, Factory, and Worker Thread Model.

---

## âœ… 2. Focus on Class Diagrams & Relationships  
**MAANG interviewers expect you to:**
- **Define clear class relationships** (Composition over Inheritance).
- **Write actual class structures** in code during interviews.

### Example: **Design a Library Management System**  
```java
class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private String ISBN;
    private boolean isAvailable;
}
class User {
    private int userId;
    private String name;
    private List<Book> borrowedBooks;
}
class Library {
    private List<Book> books;
    private List<User> users;
    
    public void borrowBook(User user, Book book) {
        // Business logic
    }
}
```
**Be ready to:**
- Explain **why** you structured it this way.
- Discuss **alternative approaches**.

## âœ… 3. Important Design Patterns for MAANG Interviews  
### ðŸ“Œ **Must-Know Creational Patterns:**  
âœ” Singleton (DB Connection, Logger)  
âœ” Factory Pattern (Object creation logic)  
âœ” Builder Pattern (Complex object creation)  

### ðŸ“Œ **Must-Know Structural Patterns:**  
âœ” Adapter (Legacy system compatibility)  
âœ” Decorator (Add functionality dynamically)  
âœ” Composite (Hierarchical structures like file systems)  

### ðŸ“Œ **Must-Know Behavioral Patterns:**  
âœ” Observer (Event-based systems)  
âœ” Strategy (Algorithm selection at runtime)  
âœ” Command (Undo/Redo functionality)  

---

## âœ… 4. API Design â€“ Think Like a MAANG Engineer  
For SE1/SE2 roles, API design is **crucial**. Know these:
- **REST vs GraphQL** â€“ When to use which?
- **Rate Limiting & Authentication** (OAuth, JWT).
- **Pagination & Caching** â€“ Handle large datasets.
- **Idempotency** â€“ Prevent duplicate transactions.

### Example: **Design a Payment API**  
```json
POST /payment  
{
  "userId": 12345,
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "paymentMethod": "CARD",
  "orderId": "A1B2C3"
}
```
**Explain:**
- **How to make it idempotent?** (Use `orderId`).
- **How to secure it?** (OAuth, TLS).
- **How to scale it?** (Async Processing, Message Queues).

# ðŸš€ Final Verdict â€“ Are You MAANG Ready?  
âœ… **For SE1 roles?** Youâ€™re **very close**. Focus on **practice**.  
âœ… **For SE2 roles?** Go deeper into **designing large-scale systems**.  

Would you like recommendations for **LLD mock interview resources** or **real MAANG interview questions**? ðŸš€
