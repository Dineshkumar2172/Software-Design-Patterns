Key Components of a Class Diagram

1. Classes → Represented as rectangles with three sections:

        * Class Name

        * Attributes (Variables)

        * Methods (Functions)

2. Relationships → How classes are connected:

        * Association (Solid line) → A general relationship between two classes.

        * Inheritance (Generalization) (Arrow with empty triangle) → "is-a" relationship (e.g., Dog is-a Animal).

        * Aggregation (Hollow diamond) → "has-a" relationship where one class contains another, but they exist independently.

        * Composition (Filled diamond) → A strong "has-a" relationship where the contained object cannot exist without the parent.

        * Dependency (Dashed line) → One class depends on another but does not own it.

Example: E-Commerce System - Imagine an E-commerce system with the following classes:

        -> User (username, email, password)

        -> Order (orderId, date, status)

        -> Product (name, price, stock)

        -> Payment (paymentId, amount, method)

Relationships Explained

        1. A User can place multiple Orders → 1 to * association.

        2. An Order contains multiple Products → * to * association.

        3. An Order is associated with one Payment → 1 to 1 association.
