     *  Unified Modeling Language (UML)
     * 
     *      1. Unified Modeling Language to model systems.
     *      2. The idea is to have a uniform way to represent the classes, objects, relationships
     *         and interactions within simple or complex systems to make it easier for developers and
     *         stakeholders to understand and communicate about the system
     * 
     *  Basic Elements of UML
     *      1. Class: A blueprint of objects, defined with a name, attributes and methods.
     *      2. Interface: A contract that defines methods that a class must implement.
     *      3. Object: An instance of a class at a runtime.
     *      4. Association: A relationship between two classes that represents interactions between objects.
     *      5. Inheritance: Represents an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass inherits from a superclass.
     *      6. Composition: A stronger association where one object is part of another and cannot exist independently.
     *      7. Aggregation: A weaker form of association where one object contains another, but they can exist independently.
